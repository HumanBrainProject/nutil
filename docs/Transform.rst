**Transform**
------------------------

**How to run Transform**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Transform* enables the batch renaming, rotation, resizing and thumbnail compilation of tiled TIFF images (max size: 4 GB).  
 
The tiled TIFF image format has an upper size limit of 4 GB. Nutil cannot transform or generate images that are bigger than 4 GB.  

1. Click “New”. Select “Transform”. 
2. Select the input folder (containing the images to be transformed), output folder and enter the transformation parameters in the Nutil GUI. The GUI includes an inbuilt user manual accessed via the “Help” buttons.  
3. Once everything is filled in press the “Save as” button. This saves a copy of the transformation parameters in a simple text file in .NUT format. This is for your own records, but may also be reloaded into Nutil via the “load” button. 
4. Nutil automatically detects the number of core processor available (8 in the example). Choose one less than the total available to ensure adequate processing power (6 or 7 here). 
5. Press “Start” and wait until the process is complete.
