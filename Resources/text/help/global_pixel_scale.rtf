<h2>Global Pixel Scale</h2>
Quantifier automatically outputs number of pixels. For real area measurements enter the area represented by one pixel in the segmentations.

<h3>IMPORTANT</h3>
As the scale is applied to all the segmentations in the series, do not use this feature if the scale is not uniform across all the segmentations. In this case leave the scale at "1" to generate output in pixels only.
