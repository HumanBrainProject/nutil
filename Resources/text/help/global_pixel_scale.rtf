<h2>Pixel Scale: area per pixel</h2>
Quantifier automatically outputs number of pixels in the reports. <br>
<br>
To convert these to real area measurements, enter the area represented by one pixel in the segmentations (e.g. 30 um<sup>2</sup>).
The reports will then include real area measurements (e.g. in um<sup>2</sup>), in addition to pixel counts.

<h3>IMPORTANT</h3>
As the scale is applied to all the segmentations in the series, do not use this feature if the pixel scale is not consistent across the segmentations.
In this case leave the scale at "1" to generate output in pixels only and do the convertion in a post-processing step.
