<h2>Object splitting</h2>
<h3>Feature for splitting objects that overlap atlas regions.</h3>
        <b>Select "NO" for small objects (e.g. cells).
        <b>Select "YES" for datasets with large objects that overlap atlas regions (e.g connectivity data). Object splitting invalidates the object counts, but gives more accurate load measures.
