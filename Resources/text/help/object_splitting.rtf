<h2>Object splitting</h2>
Feature for splitting objects that overlap atlas regions.
<p>Select NO for small objects (e.g. cells). The object splitting feature invalidates the object count output.</p>
<p>Select YES for datasets with large objects that overlap atlas regions, connectivity datasets, etc. This invalidates the object counts but gives more accurate load measurements.<p>
