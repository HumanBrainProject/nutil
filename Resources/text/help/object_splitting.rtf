<h2>Object Splitting</h2>

Turn this feature <b>ON</b> to divide segmented objects that overlap atlas regions, with individual pixels assigned their precise anatomical location. This gives accurate load measurements but invalidates the object counts.

<p>Select "NO" for small objects (e.g. cells).<br>
Select "YES" for segmentations with large objects that overlap atlas regions (e.g connectivity data).</p>

<p>See the user manual for more information.</p>
