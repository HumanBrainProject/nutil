<h2>Custom masks</h2>

Use this feature to define which parts of the sections to include in the analysis.
Masks for each section should be saved in the segmentation directory with unique ID and "_mask" extension.

<h3>Use case</h3>
The mask feature is useful for investigating right/left hemisphere expression differences. To do this, provide a mask that
differentiates the two hemispheres and run quantifier twice to generate separate reports for each hemisphere.
