<h2>Output report format</h2>
Select either comma-separated values format (CSV) or Microsoft Excel format (XLSX).

<h3>Recommendation</h3>
We recommend the CSV format in most cases. This is because CSV files are much faster to generate than XLSX (processing time is reduced from hours to seconds), and are rapidly converted to XLSX in Excel.
